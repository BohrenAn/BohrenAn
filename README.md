### Hi, i'm Andres Bohren ðŸ‘‹

I am a Cloud Architect working in the beautiful City of Bern Switzerland

My Passion is Information Technology and Security all around the Microsoft Ecosystem, especially the Cloud (M365 / Azure).
I'm an Exchange and Microsoft Teams Expert and like to work with Exchange Online, MDO 365, Microsoft Teams, Active Directory, AAD Connect, Azure AD and Security.
Became a PowerShell Enthusiast back in the Exchange 2007/2010 days and wrote a lot of helpful PowerShell Scripts. Some of them are published at my GitHub Repo.

- Published a PowerShell Module to make it more easy to analyze Spam Mails in Exchange Online [Icewolf.EXO.SpamAnalyze in PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Icewolf.EXO.SpamAnalyze).
- Published a PowerShell Module to simplify Exchange / Exchange Online MAPI Permissions [Icewolf.Exchange.MAPI in PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Icewolf.Exchange.MAPI/)
